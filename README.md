# Football Data Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my Premier League Data Web Scraping Project! In this project, I will be using web scraping techniques to extract data from various online sources related to the English Premier League, one of the most popular football leagues in the world. With the data collected, I will create visualizations that will allow users of my web application to better understand the trends and patterns in the Premier League over the years. The project will involve using Python programming language and various libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Pandas. By the end of this project, I aim to showcase my ability to collect, process and visualize data in a meaningful way. Additionally, I will be using Streamlit to create an interactive web application that will display the data visualizations I create.
